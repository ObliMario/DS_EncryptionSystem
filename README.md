# DS_EncryptionSystem
We have created a software that implements the generalized encryption and storage method in an app, so that it can be used by anyone with a computer with Linux-Ubuntu operating system. The software makes use of a graphical interface designed with the Tkinter package.
This project allows user to encode and decode any digital file. The encryption keys are the initial conditions of "x0". 
In order to open the app you must run the python code "GUI.py"
